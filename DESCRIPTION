Description: Paperdrugs is a package to get pharmaceutical 
    suggestions for altered genes identified when comparing two
    expression profiles. The package identifies significally 
    altered biological pathways and the genes with altered expression
    in those pathways. Those genes serve as potential drug targets
    and a search in DGIdb is performed. The obtained suggestions 
    are rated according to their effect on the target gene.
